1) Function minPatches

        a) This function takes a vector of integers nums and an integer n as parameters.
        b) It aims to find the minimum number of patches (additional numbers) needed to make the sum of elements in nums reach at least n.
        c) It initializes maxreach to 0, which represents the maximum sum achievable using the elements in nums and the patches added so far.
        d) It initializes ans to 0, which represents the count of patches added.
        e) It iterates through each element in nums:
                --> If the current element is greater than maxreach+1, it means there's a gap in the sum. So, it adds patches until the gap is filled. After adding 
                patches, if maxreach is greater than or equal to n, it returns the count of patches added (ans).
                --> Otherwise, it adds the current element to maxreach and checks if it reaches or exceeds n. If so, it returns ans.
        f) If maxreach is still less than n after processing all elements in nums, it adds patches until maxreach is greater than or equal to n and returns ans.

2) Function main

        a) This function reads input for the integer n.
        b) It then reads n integers and adds them to a vector v.
        c) It reads input for the integer k.
        d) It calls the minPatches function with the vector v and integer k, and prints the result.
