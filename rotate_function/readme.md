Function maxRotateFunction:

              1) This function takes a reference to a vector of integers nums as input.
              2) It initializes n to the size of the vector nums, sum to 0, and rotation to 0.
                        It calculates the initial rotation value by summing up i * nums[i] for each index i in the array.
              3) It initializes max_rotation to the initial rotation value.
              4) It then iterates from 1 to n - 1 to calculate the rotation values after each rotation.
                        It updates rotation based on the formula rotation = rotation + sum - n * nums[n - k], which simulates the rotation function for each rotation.
                        It updates max_rotation to store the maximum rotation value encountered.
              7) Finally, it returns max_rotation, which holds the maximum value of the rotation function for the array nums.

Function Main:
              
              1) It prompts the user to enter the size of the array and then reads n integers into the vector nums.
              2) It calls the maxRotateFunction function to calculate the maximum rotation value for the array nums.
              3) It prints the result max_rotation to the standard output.
