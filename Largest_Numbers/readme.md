The code aims to form the largest possible number by concatenating elements from a given vector of integers. 

1) Comparator Function:

    a) This function compares two integers a and b by converting them into strings p and q.
    b) It compares the concatenation of p+q and q+p. The comparison is based on which combination (ab or ba) results in a larger string when concatenated.
    c) The function returns true if p+q is greater than q+p, indicating that a should come before b in the sorted order.

2) largestNumber Function:

    a) This function takes a vector of integers vec as input and aims to form the largest number possible by concatenating elements of vec.
    b) It sorts the vector vec using the comparator function. (This sorting is crucial for the greedy approach as it ensures that the elements 
     are arranged in a way that maximizes the resulting number's magnitude.)
    c) It then concatenates the sorted elements into a string res in the sorted order.
          If the resulting string res starts with '0', it means all elements were '0', so it returns "0" directly.
          Otherwise, it returns the concatenated string res, which represents the largest possible number.

3) main Function:

    a) Prompts the user to enter the numbers and populates the vector v.
    b) Calls the largestNumber function with the vector v and prints the largest possible number formed by concatenating the elements.
